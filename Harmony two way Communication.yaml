########################### Two Way Control ####################################
#  This is the automation configuration that was used in the youtube video: to
#. add two way communication to the Logitech Harmony Hub
# - This code serves as a template but you will need to modify entity names and 
#   state names based on your devices. Furthermore different devices may have some
#   unique caveats regarding how they integrate with Home Assistant that may need
#   to be accounted for

# - Please let me know if your setup has unique situations which these automations don't
#   account for

# - This first automation syncs the harmony to the off whenever the TV is turned off
# - The trigger is the TV changing states from on to off.
# - The action is to turn off the runnning activity on the harmony
# - Note if the TV was turned off using the harmony,then we don't want this automation
#   to run since the harmony will already be off so we will declare the condition that
#   the harmony is on for this automation to run.

  alias: Harmony Sync Power Off
  trigger:
    platform: state
    entity_id: media_player.sharp_aquos_tv
    from: "on"
    to: "off"

# - In your setup you may have activites where your reciever is on but your TV is off
#   such as listening to music, in that case you will use this automation
# - We will specify two triggers, the TV turning off and the reciever turning off. The
#   automation will trigger when either the TV or the reciever turns off however, in 
#   addition we will specify condtion that both the reciever and TV have to be off
# - Thus this automation will turn the harmony off if both the reciever and TV have been
#   turned off

# - In the next automations, we will assign the harmony the correct activity based
#   on the current selected input of the reciever. If you use your TV for switching
#   instead of your reciver, the only thiing that needs to be changed is the entity
#   id should be changed to be your TV
# - Note you should check using developer tools what each input is called
# - The condtion is defined similar to the last automation to ensure the automation
#   doesn't trigger when it doesn't have too.
